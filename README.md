</p>

## Overview

This repository contains the Arduino code and project documentation for a bike speedometer and computer based on Arduino and a Hall Sensor. The system accurately measures wheel movement to provide valuable bike metrics such as speed, distance covered, time, maximum speed, acceleration, and velocity-time graphs.

The system calculates bike metrics by analyzing the time difference between sensor triggers when the magnet passes by it. The setup involves placing a magnet on the front wheel's spokes, triggering a Hall Sensor on the fork. This data is then processed by an Arduino Uno powered by a Xiaomi PowerBank.
